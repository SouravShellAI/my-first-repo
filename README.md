# My First Repository

Hi, I’m **Sourav Mondal** here, a B.Tech CSE student currently diving into Python with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This repository marks the beginning of my development journey. Here, I’ll be:
- Practicing Python fundamentals
- Exploring core concepts through hands-on coding
- Documenting my progress as I build toward more advanced AI/ML projects

### About Me
- 🎓 Computer Science undergraduate
- 🔍 Focused on Python, AI, and real-world problem solving
- 💡 Passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement through code

This is my first step — many more to come.
